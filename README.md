# Example app with Storybook

This example shows a default set up of Storybook using [`@storybook/nextjs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storybook/nextjs). Included in this example are stories that demonstrate the ability to use Next.js features in Storybook.

### TypeScript

As of v6.0, Storybook has built-in TypeScript support, so no configuration is needed. If you want to customize the default configuration, refer to the [TypeScript docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/typescript).


### Run Storybook

```bash
npm run storybook
```

### Build Static Storybook

```bash
npm run build-storybook
```

You can use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) to deploy Storybook. Specify `storybook-static` as the output directory.
